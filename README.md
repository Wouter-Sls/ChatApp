# ChatApp

This is a Flutter project.

This project was made during the Flutter & Dart course.

In this project I learned how to create a signup and log in for users and store this data in Firebase cloud.
When creating an account the user must give an email address, username, password and a user profile image.
A logged in user stays logged in even when closing the application until the user decides to log out by clicking the log out button.

Furthermore, when a user logs in, I learned how a basic chat application is created where the history of the chat is stored and retrieved in Firebase cloud. When a user gets a messages and the app is not open, the user wil receive a notification.
